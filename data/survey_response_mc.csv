KoG isnt that easy and time consuming.  I set a goal for myself which is to usually reach KoG in 3 days.,The scam. Sometimes it feels like RNG knows exactly what you want and then gives you everything other than particular card. One time I had to dig deep into a main box (147 packs deeps) to get 2 copies of Cybernetic Overflow which is a R rarity and is 6 copies in that particular box. Wasnt fun. I almost cried because resources for digging through these packs isnt easily accessible,Yes,,Minnow (I spend a little bit),F2P is time consuming as compared to P2P. P2P players can get access to pre built decks that you can tweak a little bit and you'd be good to go.

I currently play gacha game(s).,2 - 3 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arknights,iOS and Android,Global,Word of mouth from someone I know,10-30 minutes,Entertained,"Lore, story, and characters","Limitations on attempting a stage. In arknights, you have a finite number of attempts to complete stages through the use of a currency called ""tactical plans"". Everyday, the currency resets to 30. A normal stage takes 1 plan while a challenge stage takes 3. This means that the amount of times you can practice stages range around 30 to 10 (excluding the free 1st try for each stage) using the plans. 

Players would normally avoid using the energy currency since it's mostly used for farming and other progressions. This is extremely true for challenge stages as failure while using energy would cost half the amount of completing the stage. A system like this is very counter-intuitive as players would instead watch guides instead of trying it themselves in order to avoid wasting energy.

One way to fix this is to either increase the daily limit for plans, decrease the cost for challenge mode, decrease the penalty for challenge mode, or just make the practice mode free.

Sometimes I am gratified by getting a pull I wanted. When I enjoyed the game more it just had a lot of little things that would keep me busy so I got a sense of completion and a bit of challenge since there's some tactical elements.","At this point in time, I need to complete daily tasks for 2+ years to unlock a character. I USED to like the designs of the characters and the story telling.","There is so much, I don't even know where to begin. Global version of this game is constantly neglected. We recently had an event that was released in Chinese and it took them several days to correct it. There are rarely updates, and it has been missing key features other versions of the game have had for years. They no longer add voice acting, they rarely do reruns, and there are long gaps of inactivity where we could easily be given fluff pulls/events/reruns. The anniversary event was recent and had over 20+ events running simultaneously so it felt like overkill. Felt really pressured to spend RL to get a chance at everything, especially after such a long dry spell of nothing going on.",Yes,,"It depends; I used to be able to spend $35+ a month when I was really enjoying the game, but recently I've moved into low spending dolphin/minnow (but I bought a discount 'monthly boost' for the year a while back and haven't really spent any funds recently)","F2P used to be good for this game. You used to be almost guaranteed to at least get an event character, and p2p guaranteed that it made the character useful. You could save your premium currency and play smart to get characters, but there are pvp battles and if you want to have an edge in that or events, you HAVE to have the character leveled up. You have to spend money to get good characters, and then level those characters. At this point in the game, the main story hasn't been updated, so the only new story is accessed through events, and if you aren't strong enough to have a team that can beat event bosses, you're locked out of the story.",12,35,Yes,Food Fantasy,"I stopped playing food fantasy for a few months and it was so liberating. I felt like I had so much time, I had more money. They had an event for a character that I really wanted and I happened to see an ad for it and came back, and then I saw that they had a log in bonus, and I'd lost the years of log ins that I'd accumulated. I'm playing now because I bought a yearly pass but I'm not enjoying it much. I also used to play Avengers Academy but it shut down. Also quit playing it because it started to cost way too much money and felt like a money grab. but the concept before it shut down was cute and I liked the characters","I hope this doesn't mess up your survey because I stopped playing a game and went back to it. I loved the characters, I thought they were cute and I liked interacting with them. I liked the little stories they would show interacting with each other.","When I was playing it before I was having fun, but it just felt like I was putting so much into the game and getting nothing back.

3/20/2022 13:02:48,Yes. I currently play gacha game(s).,> 4 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Another Eden,Android,Global,Read about it online,beyond 2 hours,"First off, I have to mention the nostalgia of playing old turn-based RPGs being a key factor when considering if I should download it or not. Then, the satisfaction of having what I expected from that, with a lot of modern quality of life extras, like instantly teleporting to specific locations. A lot of RPGs that try getting those nostalgia points end up repeating over and over the same formula with pixelated graphics, slow battles and antiquated level up systems, so I really enjoy AE's take on keeping the formula fresh, while still having most of the things I used to enjoy from them."," I really like the fact that there is no forced multiplayer interaction via rankings that serve no purpose of my own. Or that there is no ""daily task"" requirements to get rewards, and the stamina-like system implemented allows for a fairly reasonable lapse of at least two days without playing before you are back at full resources, so there is no real pressure to come back playing. But the one thing I enjoy the most is that there is no such thing as limited events, every single collab, side story or side content has been free and you can farm it whenever you like without the weekly/monthly countdown of expiration date (there is one exception with some specific rewards on release date or for some festivities, but you are not missing entire plotlines or characters from those).
 The thing that keeps me playing is the fact that there is always something to do, and while some side content might seem like a chore, you are not particularly forced to finish them, leaving you to focus on the things you enjoy. At the moment, being at the endgame and having finished most of the things I wanted to, I am just casually farming items that might be worthwhile for future story updates."," One of the things I would dislike is that even though having a lot of free/permanent free content is cool, it does add up to a lot of app space over time, which makes the loading time take longer and the app to perform slower at certain places. Nothing game breaking, but it might be a concern in the future.
 Another area the game could improve in, is in the port to Steam, which presents a similar problem while being borderline unplayable due to the same issues.",No,I have no budget,,,,,Yes,Dragon Providence,The game was shut down/no longer accessible,,,,,,,,,Yes,"Other mobile games, Console games, PC games",18-24,Male,Reddit,South America

Grinding can be fun if the combat itself is good, but here it was both too much RNG, too annoying to use (long load-times, encounters had nothing to do with the story, strategy was always the same and depended on Limited Units), as well as really uninteractive. I didn't feel like I was doing much. Spend two minutes activating skills, hope your random attack cards are right, click them, wait for the animations for everyone to finish (~30s - 1 min?), repeat. Attack cards were random 5 out of 15, skills had cooldowns, etc. Turn-based is great if it's done well, but here it was getting pretty boring. The design-philosophy of having you spend 5-10 hours every day grinding during events for miniscule rewards was even worse. The only challenging Content required paid units too. Then comes the fact that there's no pity, so you could spend over 1000 without getting anything and the Craft Essences (Equipable Items from the gacha) being annoying to manage and get, and the frustration outweighs any fun. Also, having story before and after each combat mission in a mission based game makes me not want to play because I don't want to start something long, and you can't pause the story.",1-2 years,Yes,75,,,,Yes,"Other mobile games, PC games",18-24,Male,Light Novel,Europe

I started keeping track of playtime and when I install it again, and I seem to reinstall it every 2-3 weeks, play for 2 days and uninstall again.

I miss the time I wasted :-(

When I just started I was really impressed by it, I liked gameplay, music, story.  (The game is NOT genshin btw)
I remember getting frustrated that I couldn't max out an event. 

When I was playing I didn't think about how I felt. I was just playing.","When I was playing I didn't think about what I dislike. Huge size? Phone overheating?

There is a set of 5 bosses with 3 difficulties each, and they all drop materials.
There are 9 weapon types and 5 elements, so 45 weapons to make + 5 buildings that also use these materials.
There ia also 4th - ""Legend"" difficulty, but it gives minimal upgrade to weapons, so I won't count it.
To max out all these weapons you need ~ HOLY SHIT I LOOKED AT OLD CALCULATOR AND ON BOSS' RELEASE AND ~year AFTER THAT, YOU NEEDED TO CLEAR A BOSS 1,010 TIMES TO MAX ALL WEAPONS. 
AND THAT'S FOR A SINGLE ELEMENT.
Sooooooooo, 5,050 CLEARS TOTAL TO MAX ALL WEAPONS IN ALL ELEMENTS???

Can't believe I actually did all that grind!!! There were periods with x2 drops, but they were only 1-2 week long and only on single boss everyday. I remember spending HOURS, TENS OF HOURS TO GRIND THESE MATERIALS IN COOP.
I was leaving my phone for ~1-2 hours on auto play to grind these materials!!!

If you also count ""Legend"" difficulty, then that would be 6,560 clears on first 3 difficulties and 340 Legend clears, which were really hard to get by themselves.

Of course, developers increased drop rates by THREE times on 3rd anniversary - year after full boss set was released. So, that's 1,683 total clears??? HOW GENEROUS

...They also made these bosses skipable...
(After you ""3 star"" the boss, you are be able to use ""Skip ticket"" to instantly clear the boss, and they also DOUBLED amount of tickets you get from daily login to 12.)

Well, it's cool... BUT WHAT ABOUT THE TIME I WASTED?

After these changes were implemented, they also started releasing new set of bosses, obviously you can't use skip tickets on them.
You need ""only"" ~400 clears to max out the weapons they give (for single element, but there 5 of them), that's only 40% of previous set, but no, thanks.

Feels like a job now, more setting up for potential fun. Most repeat content is poorly done. ","Potential that they might one day have standards, not looking like it though. ","Developer is pretty awful. Ignores complaints with proof, will ban if your persist on social media to hide information. Broken mechanics, unfinished mechanics, has 5 modes that require good servers, awful servers. Developers are liars as well. If I put in everything that needs improvement, you'd have like 50 paragraphs. The thing that needs improvement the most, is the devs need accountability, once they have that, the valid complaints can be taken seriously and make massive improvements to this game.

Kong Studios has very poor options for sales, like 2 at best, one being monthly and the other rare. Rest are awful. The way they behave should net them no money, but a fool part with their money quite easily.

By the time I left, like 95% of the roster was worthless. ","The strategy on boss fights before a certain point. You're asking about what we miss most, it kind of includes the emotion.","Gimmicky boss battles.

I currently play gacha game(s).,3 - 4 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arrowmancer,Android,Global,Read about it online,between 1 hour and 2 hours,"Happy overall, though there's the occasional frustration.","The whole gimmick of this game is that you can import AI-generated characters from Waifu Labs and roll for them, and that's pretty great. You can basically play with your own characters, though you do have to roll for them... and maybe even reroll their passives beforehand if you want to get one that's good. Though, that's not too much of an issue, and since you choose what goes in the custom gacha, you can give yourself plenty of time to save up gems for a favorite. Plus, the actual storyline is fun - not always the most sensible, but definitely entertaining. The events are good too, with special fixed 6* units. The combat is interesting as well-- definitely a unique system. I'd say the biggest motivators are the storyline and the desire to get all my best Waifu Labs creations in game. ","The balancing is a little off for how the various currencies/materials are handled. Gems feel plentiful at first, then you realize you're getting a new event every two weeks, plus your own custom gacha. You can certainly roll a few times, but the current income doesn't make it entirely sustainable. Leveling does give you more gem income, but new players are more likely to use lots of gems since they have less units, and the game's synergy mechanics encourage having 12 good units for a full party. Then there's mana and coins-- both can be farmed, though mana is limited by stamina, while coins are not. That's not inherently bad, especially since there's no auto to abuse coins with, but coins are only used on unit leveling, role switching, and limit breaks, while mana is used for forms (purely cosmetic) and limit breaks. Limit breaks are fine, but coins should be given more of a use, since you can easily start to overflow with them. Plus the season mana and zodiac mana seem to come at similar rates, when you use much more of the season mana.
Though I seem like I'm complaining a lot, this game is a recently released indie game (little over a month now), so it's understandable that they haven't got this all balanced out yet.",Yes,,Minnow (I spend a little bit),"Not much, it was just a 5-pull worth of gems and a single random 4* (custom appearance, but the stats were random). That did help in the early levels I guess, but it's not much in the long run.",0.99,0.99,Yes,Crash Fever,"Slight combination of time and appeal-- though, I think I mostly just got caught up in real life stuff or other, non-gacha games at the time.","The gameplay was pretty fun- not quite match-3, but similar vibes. Getting to blow up the board with 30 giant bombs was always pretty good. There were plenty of events, near-constantly- whether those were from global, JP, or Taiwan server stories or crossover events. It was nice to have an ever-increasing collection of maxed units from the events, though I rarely got any good ones from the event stages or gacha. The stories were always pretty good, even if it was a bit hard to try to follow so many different storylines. 
(Also, since it's a bit hard to express with the given questions-- I was mostly F2P, but occasionally bought monthly passes with money from Google play gift cards from Christmas or my birthday.)","There was definitely some major powercreep going on-- I played the game a bit off and on over a few years, and the skills that used to be extremely powerful became fairly common. It also didn't help that the newest stages made clearing them without the set of specific traits the new gacha units had practically impossible. You could use friend units on most solo stages, or join a co-op room for no energy, but it's still quite difficult to make it through stages other than the easiest difficulty available. Plus, the constant onslaught of events overlapping each other made saving up quite difficult, even if polygons (premium currency) came in somewhat often. Also, many of the events were storylines, but if you miss one event, you couldn't always see that story when the next chapter comes around. Sometimes you could, sometimes not, but the mixing of events from different servers made things a little inconsistent.

It's not grindy -- stage farming is automated and short for the most part, there's a good passive income of two main resources (money and experience); events are plentiful in story, gameplay and rewards, overall variety (not only in combat stages and its mechanics, general direction of the story, but also in game modes -- solo, co-op, rougelike), they are rather easy to clear yet provide challenge.

Requires little time and management -- under 2 hours each day, most things are passive or automated outside of new content which can be done slowly but surely throughout the week(s). No 'powercreep' per se or the need to max out units since everything can be cleared with low rarity unit compositions or with higher rarity units but any playstyle you want, the important part is strategy, understanding of game and stage mechanics and knowing how you can utilize your units to suit the goals, it doesn't get boring thanks to this, too. Unlitimed inventory space and all other small QoL features that save your irl sanity are a breath of fresh air.
F2P-friendliness as in, you can pull on all banners for a guaranteed 5-6* unit (6* rarity is the highest rarity) on first 10 pulls (said guaranteed unit might drop anywhere during those 10 pulls, it might be on the very first pull even) and not only you will never run out of needed currency, but it will keep accumulating allowing you to save for a certain unit you might really wish to get from soft pity (hitting hard pity is not possible for F2P unless they save for like a year in which I see no point, that's not a pleasant playing experience).
5 and 6* units also can be bought in the shop with the currency that's easy to accumulate (in fact, it takes precisely 1.5 month for every 6* purchase), and if you don't want to buy anyone, you can buy additional pulls instead (which take 2 months to save for) and they almost guarantee you a soft pity (yout get 38 pulls, and the soft pity kick ins on 50 pulls). Not to mention other plentiful freebies in the shop, during events or other celebrations.
And you don't need to have many copies of the same unit, they all work as is from just one copy -- the only thing you might need is masteries on skills, but they are not difficult to upgrade at all. You also can borrow any unit you want from your friends & randoms to any stage.

The overall quality and variety of the game's design, art (especially chibi art is done right for once), UI&UX, sound & music.
Deep lore and VN-style of storytelling is quite pleasant.
Nice enough ratio of female to male units latter of which are strong in performance, story presence and art quality. (I don't play gachas that are too female-cast heavy or are all-female cast)","Not enough male units. I'd like to see more male units released.
Also, some decisions on 'we're buffing units' patches seem like devs don't really know their own game, which is a shame (good units get better, but under-performed units get abysmal buffs that change nothing or buffs that don't even suit their playstyle which also changes nothing for them).",Yes,,Minnow (I spend a little bit),"It feels nicer (a little bit of extra pulls and stamina are a nice bonus, and it's my small thanks for the game), but ultimately doesn't change anything.

I've been playing since English launch so I've pretty much completed most activities and collected almost all the characters available; this gives a sense of accomplishment and I am quite satisfied looking through my collection of characters and gear.

It also offers satisfying escapism; I play pretty normal games besides Azur Lane so it really brings something unique to the table. It's mainly a waifu collector game where you can increase the affection of each of the characters the more you use them. You are the ""Shikikan"" or ""Captain"" of the ""Azur Lane"" fleet. In short, you build your own harem and are constantly increasing the strength, and affection of your ship-girls. I generally prefer to spend my time alone and have very little interest in an actual relationship, this game is obviously not a 1-for-1 replacement for a relationship, but it does help relieve the desire for one.","1.) I've been playing since release.

2.) Not pay to win. The revenue model revolves around selling reskin textures of characters. This means I never feel pressure to pay-up.

3.) I like the gameplay, art design, and characters. It's a very casual game that requires very little user input (AFK game).

4.) It's a somewhat popular game so the chances of the game failing as a product are relatively low. This means my time investment is relatively safe.

5.) The devs listen to the community and often compensate extremely generously for mistakes.

","I like most that it's not pay to win. I HATE the way pretty much every modern game is monetized these days. Box cost, DLC & Expansions, Lootboxes, Cosmetic Shop, XP & Item Boosters, Subscriptions, etc. It's nearly impossible to find games these days where you just get to play the game without being pressured to spend more, and more, and more money. It's a sad state of affairs when a GACHA game of all things is more consumer friendly than Triple A games.

I'm a very critical person when it comes to gaming as I am very anti-corporate and have been conditioned to NEVER give corporations the benefit of the doubt, but...

The only other as visually beautiful thing I know of is Mononoke (Tv series) anime","Idk, I like it how it is, but I know a lot of Western gacha gamers complain about a lot the mechanics, considering it typical Chinese game, as in grindly and bothersome. XD I guess I like Chinese style? Also, I played Western gacha and after this, now Eastern gacha seems hard or p2w - anime gacha gamers just lack this experience to fully appreciate their luck. ;)) But, considering what others on the sub are saying (re: what's important for them) I guess sweep function instead of endless auto grind might be nice? and a pity system lower than, idk how much even, 500 pulls?

ALSO the characters' icons are hideous. horrible. and they're changing the previous, moderately decent ones to new, more ""computer-graphics like"" ones - and they're so ugly. seriously, you should check it to have a good laugh.

And, and no story/plot, just gacha - although this, I could stand, because they put this whole thing into the bigger lore via ""a cantina where aliens from all the galaxy far far away play with figurines of legendary heroes"", so at least the whole gacha aspect and playing with actual characters from the universe makes sense.

My account is pretty much maxed for the strong characters, which make playing new maps/stages relatively easy—most of my excitement now comes from freely grinding for the characters I love and saving in-game currency for new gachas. ","Character design (I like to grind for ""waifus"" and ""husbandos"" over strong characters), gameplay (it's strategic so I enjoy the challenge, and the game also provides different modes of gameplay e.g. roguelike, multivariate co-op etc., so it's not too repetitive over time), and consistency of new events/side stories (the promo vids also hype up the events a lot, making for a lot of anticipation everytime).","Length and prose of stories—I love the overall lore of the game but sometimes the chapters are too tedious to read. I also find that the writing style for different events/side stories can be quite inconsistent (i.e. one event can be enjoyable to read, but another would completely turn me off from reading because it's too boring), so I no longer read the lore myself and would prefer hearing about it from others instead.",No,My F2P gaming experience wouldn't be any different from a paying gamer,,,,,Yes,Onmyoji,I felt the game no longer appealed to me,"The excitement with new characters mostly, but it got pretty repetitive once I got the achievement for ""collecting all of the SSR/SP characters"" (by this point I had played this game for 2-3 years already), then afterwards it just felt like I was grinding everyday for in-game currency so I can maintain the ""collected all SSR/SP characters"" status (this is important for this game specifically because it gives you better rate-up %s for new gachas and special in-game rewards; cruel way to keep you grinding everyday). As a result, new characters stopped being exciting for me because I just saw it as another character I have to gacha for to maintain that ""all SSR/SP characters"" status for those benefits (sorry in advance for using this survey to rant).","Randomized attribute bonuses for characters' weapons. Not literal weapons though, they're called ""shikigami""s that you equip onto the characters to enhance their attributes; leveling up the shikigami gives you random attribute bonuses. Since it's random, you really have to play your luck with it, and it can really affect your gameplay at an advanced level if your shikigami attributes are not the best. For example, speed attributes are particularly important for PVP gameplay in the game, yet it's incredibly difficult to max the speed attribute (took me four years to max it, whereas some players may get it within 2 years just by pure luck). It can be annoying if you're trying to top the leaderboards for certain events but can't because your attribute bonuses are not as good as other players (given that you use the same characters and types of shikigami).",more than 4 years,Yes,150,,,,Yes,"Other mobile games, Console games, PC games, FPS (or TPS)/battle royale, social simulation, racing, rhythm games.",18-24,Female,Anime,Asia

Sometimes, only a few minutes,. Other times, for several hours depending on my schedule",I don't feel like I have to log in daily. ,"Sure their stuff is weekly but it allows me to decide when and how fast should I clear the weekly stuff despite being grindy in certain aspects.

Sure gacha rates aren't the best for individual characters rates but it's pity system is one of the best since it allows me to pick the character that's ""sparkable"". Also, sure the individual character rate is low but the material to upgrading the character to the max IS grindable in game

And with so much stamina given to the point that a day may not even be enough to use EVEN 1/4 of my stamina pots, I can decide for how long I wish to grind things in this game and at what pace.

While there are some stuff that are timegated, majority of the relevant things that affects progression (like the weapons for the weapon grid) can be grinded for as much as you could. For raids however, you can join other people's raids to grind as much as you could if you already used up your daily host.

Sure weapon drop rates are low in exchange for nigh-infinite grind but it's better this way so there's more room for managing schedule or pace of progression in one way or another.

Also, the game likes to give free rolls and in game currency, which helps saving up for pity.

And since the game is keeping up with JP updates WHILE having the english option OFFICIALLY, it's easy to keep up with the original live updates for the game. And because of this, Global Shaft isn't a thing (maybe aside from the ping or Guild War times but otherwise, it isn't much of a problem)

but then again, since this is a game that's run with a browser, sometimes it's understandable. But more UI improvements the better.
